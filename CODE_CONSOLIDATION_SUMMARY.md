# Code Consolidation Summary

## Overview

Consolidated and cleaned up the package index building and polling code to eliminate redundancy and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Shared Utilities (`scripts/registry_utils.py`)

**Consolidated common functionality:**
- `GitHubAPIClient`: Centralized GitHub API client with rate limiting
- `RegistryManager`: Manages index.json reading/writing operations  
- Shared utility functions: `has_wheel_assets()`, `parse_version()`, etc.
- Unified logging setup

**Eliminates:**
- Duplicate `get_releases()` functions
- Duplicate GitHub API handling
- Duplicate registry loading/saving code
- Inconsistent error handling

### 2. Refactored `build_index.py`

**Before:**
- Hardcoded package list (13 packages)
- Custom rate limiting implementation
- Duplicate API client code
- Output to 'simple' directory

**After:**
- Loads packages from `index.json` (single source of truth)
- Uses shared `GitHubAPIClient` with rate limiting
- Cleaner, focused code
- Output to 'dist' directory
- Added verbose logging option

### 3. Refactored `poll_external_releases.py`

**Before:**
- Standalone functions for GitHub API
- Duplicate registry management
- Basic error handling

**After:**
- Uses shared `GitHubAPIClient` and `RegistryManager`
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Cleaner function signatures

### 4. Updated Workflows

**Build workflow (`build-index.yml`):**
- Updated to use 'dist' output directory
- Updated to use upload-artifact v4
- Fixed package counting logic

**Polling workflow (`poll-external-packages.yml`):**
- Uses consolidated scripts
- Better error handling

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All packages defined in `index.json` only
2. **No Code Duplication**: Shared utilities eliminate redundant code
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified logging and error patterns
4. **Better Rate Limiting**: Centralized GitHub API client with proper limits
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to core logic only need to be made once
6. **Testability**: Shared utilities can be easily unit tested

## File Structure

```
scripts/
├── registry_utils.py       # NEW: Shared utilities
├── build_index.py          # REFACTORED: Uses shared utilities
├── poll_external_releases.py  # REFACTORED: Uses shared utilities
└── generate_metadata.py    # UNCHANGED
```

## Testing

Both scripts were tested and work correctly:

- ✅ `build_index.py` builds from registry successfully
- ✅ `poll_external_releases.py` polls external repos correctly  
- ✅ No more "hardcoded package list" issues
- ✅ Consistent output directory structure

## Migration Notes

- **Output directory**: Changed from 'simple'/'docs' to 'dist' for consistency
- **Package source**: Now reads from `index.json` instead of hardcoded lists
- **API calls**: All GitHub API calls now go through shared client with rate limiting
- **Error handling**: More robust and consistent across all scripts

The code is now more maintainable, less error-prone, and ready for production use.
